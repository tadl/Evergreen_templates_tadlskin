TADL Template Toolkit skin

This repository currently contains the TADL template toolkit skin and
support files.

Focus at present is on the OPAC.

Usage
=====

These templates can be used by placing them in a directory specified in
your Apache server's OILSWebTemplatePath variable.

    # Templates will be loaded from the following paths in reverse order.
    PerlAddVar OILSWebTemplatePath "/openils/var/templates"
    PerlAddVar OILSWebTemplatePath "/openils/var/templates_tadlskin"

A full copy of the rel_2_2 opac templates has been placed in
templates_tadlskin for convenience while testing and developing. We'll
likely remove the unchanged templates at some point.


Whatever
=====
Do the thing. Whatever.
